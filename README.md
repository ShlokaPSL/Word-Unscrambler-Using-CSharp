# Word-Unscrambler-Using-CSharp

This application accepts a set of scrambled words as input from the user. 
This input can be provided in one of two ways -
1. In the form of a comma separated list of scrambled words  OR
2. The scrambled words can be entered and saved by the user in a separate file and this file's path along with file name can be provided as input.

The application will then compare the list of scrambled words with another pre-defined list of 100 common English words, and would provide a list of unscrambled words as output if a match is found, or would provide an appropriate message to user if no match is found.
